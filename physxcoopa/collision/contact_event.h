/**
 * @file contact_event.h
 * @brief ContactEvent -- one enter/stay/exit notification, queued by PhysicsWorld during the
 *        substep loop and drained once per frame by the caller (PhysicsSystem, for a Scene-bound
 *        world; test.cpp directly, for headless use).
 *
 * Queued rather than fired immediately for the same reason Phase 3's on_substep deferred
 * structural mutations: a callback that reacts to a collision/trigger event might spawn or
 * destroy a body, which must not happen while the solver is mid-iteration over this step's
 * manifolds. This is a *different* queue from that one -- that one defers structural
 * *mutation*, this one defers *notification* -- both exist because either kind of callback
 * could otherwise corrupt an in-flight solve.
