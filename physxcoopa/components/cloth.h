/**
 * @file cloth.h
 * @brief ClothComponent -- Scene-authorable cloth sheet, resolved to a cloth::Cloth inside
 *        PhysicsWorld by PhysicsSystem at bind time.
 *
 * The component holds only AUTHORING data (grid dimensions, tunables, anchor descriptions by
 * object name). The simulated state -- particles, constraints, tethers -- lives in the
 * PhysicsWorld, reachable through cloth(). That split matters for two consumers: a renderer
 * needs the live particle positions every frame and gets them without a copy, and the solver
 * never has to walk the scene graph.
 *
 * Anchor object names are resolved by PhysicsSystem::regather_cloths_(), NOT by the YAML parser.
 * The parser runs while the hierarchy is still being built, so a sibling named in YAML may not
 * exist yet -- the same rule HingeJointComponent's `connected_object` follows.

 * @class ClothComponent
 * @brief A rectangular XPBD cloth sheet owned by the object this is attached to.
 *
 * The sheet is built in the owner's local XY plane (normal +Z) at `size`, centred on the owner's
 * Transform, so moving/rotating that Transform in a scene file places the sheet -- exactly like
 * any other authored geometry. After that the particles live in WORLD space and the Transform is
 * no longer their parent: the owner's Transform is a spawn pose, not a per-frame one. A renderer
 * wanting object-space vertices divides back out by the owner's world matrix.
 *
 * Example YAML:
 * @code
 * - type: Cloth
 *   resolution: { x: 25, y: 25 }
 *   size: { x: 4.0, y: 4.0 }
 *   mass: 1.0
 *   bend_compliance: 0.00005
 *   damping: 0.08
 *   thickness: 0.03
 *   friction: 0.5
 *   self_collision: true
 *   wind: { x: 0.6, y: 0.0, z: 0.0 }
 *   wind_turbulence: 0.8
 *   anchors:
 *     - object: ball
 *       point: { x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 1.0 }
 *       radius: 0.4
 * @endcode
 *
 * Like HingeJointComponent, binding is creation-time only: editing `resolution`/`size`/`anchors`
 * after the cloth exists has no effect until the component is removed and re-added. The runtime
 * tunables in `params` are the exception -- they are read fresh every substep, so wind, friction,
 * damping and gravity_scale can all be driven live through cloth()->params.
