/**
 * @class HingeJointComponent
 * @brief Connects the object this is attached to, to `connected_object`, via a hinge.
 *
 * Unlike dynamics::HingeJoint (which needs both sides' anchor/axis explicitly, each already in
 * that body's own local frame), this component only takes ONE anchor/axis -- in THIS object's
 * own local frame -- matching Unity's HingeJoint default (`autoConfigureConnectedAnchor`):
 * PhysicsSystem computes the connected side's anchor/axis automatically from wherever
 * `connected_object` currently sits, at the moment this joint binds. This is deliberately a
 * one-shot, creation-time-only resolution -- editing this component's fields at runtime (or
 * `connected_object` itself) after the joint has already been created has no effect until the
 * whole joint is torn down and rebuilt (a structural scene change: this component or its owner
 * being removed and re-added), the same "creation-time only" trim already used elsewhere in
 * this project for lower-priority runtime-reconciliation cases (e.g. RigidbodyComponent's
 * center_of_mass_override).
 *
 * Both this object and `connected_object` must already have a bound Collider (the same
 * "Collider is the binding key" convention every other physics component in this codebase
 * follows -- a bare Rigidbody/Transform with no Collider isn't reachable from scene authoring
 * today, see RigidbodyComponent's own file doc for the identical existing limitation).
