/**
 * @file cloth.h
 * @brief Data types for the XPBD cloth solver: particles, distance constraints, tethers,
 *        anchors, tunables, and the Cloth aggregate itself.
 *
 * Cloth is deliberately NOT expressed as rigid bodies. A dynamics::Body carries an orientation,
 * two inertia tensors, sleep state, prev_ and last_written_ poses and a broadphase proxy -- over
 * 200 bytes and one AABB-tree node each. A 25x25 sheet would therefore cost 625 bodies, 625
 * tree proxies and 625 entries in every IslandUnionFind rebuild, for particles that have no
 * rotation, no inertia and no pairwise contacts with each other. Instead a Cloth owns a flat
 * ClothParticle array and the whole sheet shares ONE broadphase query per substep, mirroring how
 * collision::Shape was split out of dynamics::Body rather than folded into it.
 *
 * The solver is small-substep XPBD (Macklin et al. 2019, "Small Steps in Physics Simulation"),
 * not the velocity-level sequential impulses dynamics/solver.h uses for rigid contacts. Three
 * reasons, in order of weight:
 *
 *   1. Stiffness. Cloth wants to be nearly inextensible. A velocity-level spring reaching that
 *      stiffness is exactly the stiff-ODE case semi-implicit Euler handles worst -- it needs
 *      either a tiny timestep or iteration counts far past the 16 velocity_iterations the rigid
 *      solver budgets. XPBD projects positions directly and is unconditionally stable at any
 *      stiffness, including infinite (compliance == 0).
 *   2. Resolution independence. XPBD's compliance is a physical material parameter (inverse
 *      stiffness, m/N), so a 15x15 and a 45x45 sheet authored with the same compliance hang the
 *      same way. A raw spring constant does not survive a resolution change.
 *   3. It is what the reference implementation does. Unity's Cloth is NvCloth, which is PBD.
 *
 * The cost is that cloth does not push rigid bodies back (one-way coupling) -- also exactly what
 * Unity does, and what keeps a 1 g sheet from destabilising a 50 kg body it is draped over.
 *
 * @see cloth_builder.h  for constructing a grid sheet and its constraint batches.
 * @see cloth_solver.h   for the substep loop itself.
 * @see cloth_collision.h for particle-vs-collision::Shape projection.
